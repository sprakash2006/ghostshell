## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS (1 min summary)

> "Traditional security blocks attackers immediately. We lose intelligence. GhostShell studies them safely—silently redirecting suspicious users into a realistic fake environment. Every command is classified by threat type. Every behavior is analyzed. Security teams get intelligence instead of alerts."

---

## 🔥 THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PARTS

1. **Show the Terminal** → Type commands, get responses
2. **Show the Dashboard** → Real-time metrics
3. **Show Live Sessions** → Color-coded threats
4. **Deep Dive Session-003** → Risk chart spikes
5. **Point Out** → "Log Destruction" behavior tag
6. **Explain** → Deception strategies keeping attackers engaged

---
